- Changed air provider radius in config to apply to the whole air quality level instead of per block to allow for tag support
- Air quality providers such as soul fire blocks and portal blocks are now controlled via dedicated block tags:
  - `thinair:blue_air_providers`
  - `thinair:green_air_providers`
  - `thinair:yellow_air_providers`
  - `thinair:red_air_providers`
